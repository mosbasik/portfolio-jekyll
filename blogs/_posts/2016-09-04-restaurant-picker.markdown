Family gets together and goes out to eat every Sunday. We have to pick a restaurant somehow. A number of constraints: some people dislike barbecue, some people dislike mexican food, some people don’t care what we eat as long as we don’t go to the same place every time. Talked to another family that put a bunch of slips of paper in a jar with restaurant names on them and drew them at random to pick. A computer program could probably do this better.
