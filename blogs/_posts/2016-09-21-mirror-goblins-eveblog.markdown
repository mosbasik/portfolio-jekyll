Gevlon Goblin is one of the most polarizing figures in Eve Online's blogging community.  He has a lot of good information, stories, rage material and market advice in his blog - but it's _very_ difficult to read any of his archives because he's using a barebones Google blogspot template, and he never kept up with his tagging.  Now that he's more or less finished playing Eve Online, it might be time to crawl all of his Eve posts and archive them in a nicely formatted, easy-to-read, easy-to-search format for posterity.  Jekyll and Github Pages seems like it could fit the bill.
