## Technology

I've been interested in tech since I was 9 years old and my parents gave me a hand-me-down laptop loaded with Windows 98.

I learned how to type on it using Mavis Beacon - then crashed it a couple of months later by trying to install a racing game on it written for Windows XP.

In 8<sup>th</sup> grade I was introduced to programming with [Turbo Pascal][pascal] and crashed my new XP machine several times.

During high school I took several Java courses, and also did all of the classic things computer kids do - proxied around the school filter to get on Facebook and Youtube, sniffed school wifi passwords with `aircrack-ng`, figured out how to access password-protected XP machines using rainbow tables, etc., etc.  At this point I had figured out how to dual boot Linux and was pretty sure that I wanted to study computer science in college.

Now, after some years in college, I've got a decent amount of experience in a number of languages and quite a lot of algorithm theory under my belt.  I've gotten _a lot of practice_ reading documentation.  And with all that, I still crash my computer a couple times a year by messing around with the internals - and have fun doing it.
