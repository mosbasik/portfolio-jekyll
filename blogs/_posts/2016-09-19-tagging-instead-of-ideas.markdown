After writing up a few of the ideas that have been bouncing around in my head the past few days into a hardcoded "Ideas" page, I realized that these kinds of entries are basically short blog entries.  This is the kind of thing I'm supposed to be publishing, that someone might be interested in if they were a subscriber (if I had an RSS feed for this blog set up).  Instead of sticking ideas by themselves in their own corner, I should just implement tagging on this blog, create an `ideas` tag and make the ideas page show all the entries that have that tag.
