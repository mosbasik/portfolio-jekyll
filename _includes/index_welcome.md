I program.  This site is where my thoughts and projects go.

I'm  interested in a little bit of everything.

Some interests are more technical - software architecture, security, web development, mobile app development, user interface design and virtual economies, to name a few.

Others are more free-form - group dynamics, dance, music production, game design, long hair, bicycling, nutrition, and sleep theory.

This blog is likely to be a fair mix between the two. (Eventually I might even make a tagging system so it's possible to find one or the other!)

Since I've only recently published this site, parts of it are likely to be under construction for a while.  I have a number of ideas that I would like to implement as I have time - so please forgive any unpolished sections.
