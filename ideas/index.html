<h1>Ideas</h1>

<p>This page shows all posts tagged as <code class="highlighter-rouge">ideas</code>.  They're going to be concepts that come to me in the shower or car or movie theater, that I might or might not ever work on.  If I do actually get any significant work done on something here, I'll remove it from this list and move it over to the projects.</p>

{% for post in site.tags['ideas'] %}
  <h2>{{ post.title }}</h2>
  {% capture content %}{{ post.content }}{% endcapture %}
  {{ content | markdownify }}
{% endfor %}
