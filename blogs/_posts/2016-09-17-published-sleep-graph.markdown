I've been logging my sleep patterns since about 2012.  The Android app I use to collect this data is fine as a collection tool but is terrible as an analysis tool. I only ever really look at the past week or two of data.  All the old data is backed up to their servers, accessible with OAuth2, and can be downloaded in `.csv` form.  I should set up some kind of script that pulls my logs down regularly and displays it on this site somehow.  I bet there are a lot of cool JS libraries for displaying data in cool ways.
