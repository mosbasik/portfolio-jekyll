<h1>Ideas</h1>

<p>This page shows all posts tagged as <code class="highlighter-rouge">ideas</code>.  They're concepts, that come in the shower or car or movie theater and that I might or might not ever work on.</p>

<p>If I do actually make progress on something here, I'll untag it (to remove the entry from this page but keep it in <a href="/blogs" target="_self">Blogs</a>) and probably make a new, more detailed post about the topic in <a href="/projects" target="_self">Projects</a>.</p>

{% for post in site.tags['ideas'] %}
  <h2>{{ post.title }}</h2>
  {% capture content %}{{ post.content }}{% endcapture %}
  {{ content | markdownify }}
{% endfor %}
