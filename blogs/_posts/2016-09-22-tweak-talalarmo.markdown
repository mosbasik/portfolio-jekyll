I just realized my favorite minimal Android alarm clock app, [Talalarmo](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=trikita.talalarmo&hl=en) by [Trikita](https://play.google.com/store/apps/dev?id=7700261326799784412&hl=en) is open source and [on Github](https://github.com/trikita/talalarmo)!  I don't know much about Android apps, but I want to tweak two things: when the alarm is inactive, I want to be able to tap anywhere on the screen to activate it (not just on the "tap here to activate" text) and when the alarm is active, I want to be able to tap anywhere on the bottom bar to deactivate it (not just on the little deactivate icon).  I wonder how hard this would be to do.  I wonder if they accept pull requests.  I wonder if pull request are difficult to figure out.
