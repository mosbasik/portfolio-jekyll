I've been wanting to try out [Jekyll][jekyll] as a simple publishing platform for a while.  I've known about it, but never got around to using it for anything.  When I decided to re-image my server, it seemed like a good time to rethink the structure of this blog.

I originally made this site in Django simply for convenience - I was doing a lot of work in Django at the time and wanted the practice.

Publishing from the default Django admin interface was tedious, though, and meant I would either have to do my own backups or risk all my content being lost if anything happened to my database.

Jekyll solves both of those problems.
