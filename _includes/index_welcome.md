I program.  This site is where my thoughts and projects go.

I think a lot of things are interesting.

Some are more technical - like software architecture, security, web development, mobile app development, user interface design and virtual economies.

Others are more free-form - group dynamics, dance, music production, game design, long hair, bicycling, nutrition, and sleep theory.

This blog is likely to be a fair mix between the two. (Eventually I might even make a tagging system so it's possible to find one or the other!)
