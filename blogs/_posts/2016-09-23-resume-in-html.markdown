What if I wrote my resume using html?  As a webpage it would be convenient and a source of truth as the most up-to-date version.  HTML/CSS would give me perfect style control, and templating provides a simple way to add more material without worrying about matching existing styling.  I could probably use something like [wkhtmltopdf](http://wkhtmltopdf.org/) to export a document when I need to print/email it.  [My current resume](https://github.com/mosbasik/resume) is done with [LaTeX](https://www.latex-project.org/), which is basically a markup language for text already - but LaTeX isn't as widespread a skill as web design, so it's kind of nice to have that displayed somewhere. Hm.
